# This varition of ERP5 is specific to disable few parts of 
# ERP5 compilation which are not supported for now on 
# RikoMagic MK802III. This file should be removed as soon
# all pendencies listed above be removed.

# Known Problems:
#  * cloudooo doesn't work due lack of openoffice 
#  * the initial database erp5 is not created automatically
#     due the lack of mrongaa.
#  * KumoFS is also disabled

# Note: Most of disabled parts are disabled by convience because it do not
#       prevents minimal erp5 to work and problems were not investigated deeply.
