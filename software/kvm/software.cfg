#XXX-Cedric : Currently, one can only access to KVM using noVNC.
#             Ideally one should be able to access KVM by using either NoVNC or VNC.
#             Problem is : no native crypto support in web browsers. So we have to disable ssl
#             In qemu builtin vnc server, and make it available only for localhost 
#             so that only novnc can listen to it.

#XXX-Cedric: Check status of https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/issues/13 to see
#            When qemu has builtin support for websockets in vnc server to get rid of 
#            Websockify (socket <-> websocket proxy server) when it is ready.
#            May solve previous XXX depending on the implementation.

#XXX-Cedric: Check status of 
#            https://www.tiolive.com/nexedi/bug_module/20110819-11F4F70 for
#            Chrome >= 14 and Firefox >=7 can access to noVNC.
