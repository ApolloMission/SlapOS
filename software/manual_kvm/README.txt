Introduction
------------

This software release is used to deploy KVM instances with a ssh access.

For extensive parameters definition, please look at parameter-input-schema.json.

Examples
--------

The following examples list how to request different possible instances of KVM
Software Release from slap console or command line.

KVM instance (1GB of RAM, 10GB of SSD, one core)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that for this flavor of KVM you will need to pass a public key for ssh
access.
Also note that since this is a special release you WILL(most likely) have to 
use the development.cfg rather than the software.cfg file for specifying your
software release

::
  myawesomekvm = request(
      software_release="/path_to_your_slapos_repository(or url)/software/manual_kvm/development.cfg",
      partition_reference="My awesome KVM",
      partition_parameter_kw={
          "nbd-host":"ubuntu-1204.nbd.vifib.net",
          "authorized-key":"<your public key>"
      }
  )

See the instance-kvm-input-schema.json file for more instance parameters (cpu-count, ram-size, disk-size, etc).

Once requested your instance shall appear on slapos.org in the "My services" section.

Starting your instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the scripts generated by SlapOS can be found in /instance_home/etc/scripts.
If you want to start your instance without those, you can access the binaries
through the /instance_home/software_release/bin directory.

SlapOS will only start the ssh server, everything else is up to you.
