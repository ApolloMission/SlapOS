<h1>ZODB performance</h1>
<p>
  A healthy zope system based on ZEO server can easily handle up to XXX requests
  per second on an SSD. A healthy zope client can easily handle up to XXX
  requests per second.
</p>
<p>
  If disk performance is too slow, then the performance on ZEO server side will
  decrease (XXX/s) and instead of having a curve with high pikes, the IO curve
  will show somehow steady shape with constant access at much lower ratio
  (ex. XXX/s). In this situation, disk must probably be analysed and eventually
  replaced.
</p>
<p>
  If network performance between server and client is poor, then ZEO Client
  takes much time to retrieve objects from ZEO server either because of high
  latency or because of packet loss. A typical ZEO Client can easily retrieve
  XXX objets / second.
</p>
<p>
  The ZODB cache defaults to 5000 objects, the threshold is easily reached when
  someone loads a web page with a lot of information. Increase this amount may
  decrease web page loading time, but be careful of available RAM on your
  machines.
