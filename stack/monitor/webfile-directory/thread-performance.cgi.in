<h1>Thread performance</h1>
<p>
  All zope instances can handle only one client request per thread to manage
  one transaction at a time. Transactions prevent from object modification
  conflict made by several users at the same time. If a transaction is in
  conflict with another one, the thread will retry it until success.
</p>
<p>
  If the processed code during a transaction is too long, then it increases the
  risk to get conflict and it increases the time to wait for client response.
  One way to check for long code is to collect process stack traces with an
  short interval and then analyze manually which function occurs several time.
